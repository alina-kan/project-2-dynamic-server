                        <p>The Global Power Plant Database is an open source database of many types of power plants around the world.
                            It has lots of different information regarding the powerplants, such as the longitude and latitude of the plant,
                            the country of origin, plant capacity, and more. It also covers around 35,000 power plants from 167 countries,
                            focusing on thermal and renewable plants. We explored the locations of the power plants, the energy
                            source used by the plant, and the plant capacity.

                            <p>This page features a table looking at the specified country, the plant name located in that country,
                                the longitude and latitude of the plant, the energy source used by that plant, and the capacity of
                                the specified plant. The information is found using the abbreviated version of the country's name. 
                            </p>
                            <li style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Energy Source:</li>
                            <p>This page features a table looking at the countries using the specified energy source, the plant name 
                                using that energy source, the specified energy source used in primary electricity generation or export,
                                and the capacity of the plant. The page also features a pie chart that specifies what energy source is 
                                shown and how many plants use them in percentages. The information is found using the abbreviated version
                                of the energy source's name.

                            <p>This page features a table looking at the countries in that capacity range, the plant name of those having
                                capacities in range, the actual capacity, and the energy source used to produce electricity, which determines
                                the capacity. The information is found by using the "low", "medium", and "high" ranges.

                        <p>Power plants are facilities designed to produce electricity from other energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, many
                            of the popular and more lucrative energy sources are nonrenewable resources that contribute to multiple kinds of pollution,
                            such as water and air pollution. There are renewable resources that can be used in order to produce as much electric energy
                            as their nonrenewable counterparts, such as solar energy and wind energy. The use of renewable energy has grown in many power
                            plants, as it is just as efficient as nonrenewable resources and these renewable resources are better for the environemt as 
                            they don't produce as much pollution or byproduct. Looking at the pie chart, the top three resources are Solar Energy, Hydrolic
                            Energy, and Wind Energy, which are all renewable resources with a little byproduct and lower pollution rates. As more power plants
                            begin to use renewable resources, the more we will be able to sustainabilly produce energy. </p>
